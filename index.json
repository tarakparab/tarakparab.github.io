Create required layers for rough work, site outlines, existing structures/objects, walls, doors and windows, labels, dimensions, etc. Create required non-annotative and annotative text styles. For more on text sizes and styles click here. Create required non-annotative and annotative dimension styles. Create required line styles. Preparing preliminary plan of the structure\nDraw plot boundaries, existing structures, other immovable obstacles on ROUGH WORK layer. Draw setback lines and offsets from obstacles by considering footings, chajjas/eaves, doors, windows, balcony locations, etc. Draw tentative outline of the building within the available area. Draw rectangles representing different rooms having minimum required areas. Move, rotate and align the rectangles in the desired locations within the building\u0026rsquo;s outline. Adjust the positions, shapes and sizes of the rectangles so as to achieve optimum utilization of available area. Relocate or remove any rooms that are not sufficiently spacious or add other non-essential rooms if additional space is available as desired. Draw wall centre lines considering optimum placements of beams, columns and slab sizes. Draw walls of desired thicknesses using offset tool in WALLS layer. Now hide or lock SITE and ROUGH WORK layers. Plan locations and sizes of openings for doors and windows. Import or draw blocks of doors and windows. Place the doors and windows at appropriate locations and alignments. Check for any oddities in the preliminary plan and make required corrections. Check for in-to-in available area of the rooms and confirm if they are sufficient. Hide all layers except WALLS. Select all walls of any particular floor and convert them into one block. Use the same block for architectural, R.C.C. and services drawings to prevent any kind of discrepancies between them. Similarly, plan and draw ground floor and other floor walls and convert them to blocks. Preparing architectural and other plans\nMake a copy of the walls block for appropriate floor plan. Place windows, doors, furnitures, sanitary items, etc. blocks in appropriate locations and in their appropriate layers. Check for any obstructions or oddities. Preparing layouts and printing\nCreate new layouts for different floors, views, etc. Set page for printing. Select printer as DWG to PDF, appropriate page size, plot style, page orientation, and select drawing scale at 1:1 in millimetres. Draw or insert page border and title-block blocks. Insert viewports of appropriate views of the plans. Add labels and dimensions inside model space of the viewports. Check for any oddities, overlaps, visibility issues. Check print preview.
